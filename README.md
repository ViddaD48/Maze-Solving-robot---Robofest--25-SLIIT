# Maze Solving robot - Robofest '25 SLIIT
 Autonomous Maze solving robot using flood fill algorithm

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository documents our participation in **RoboFest 2025**, an autonomous micromouse competition organized by the **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**.

The challenge required designing and developing a **fully autonomous micromouse robot** capable of exploring and solving an unknown maze and reaching the destination in the shortest possible time without any external control.

Our robot was developed in full compliance with the **RoboFest 2025 University Category Technical Specifications**, with a strong focus on precision, stability, and real-time decision-making.
